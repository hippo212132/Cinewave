              <h2>What Is a Carbon Footprint?</h2>
              <p>
                A <strong>carbon footprint</strong> is the total amount of carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) released into the atmosphere as a result of human activities ‚Äî such as driving, eating, or using electricity.
                 It helps us measure our individual or organizational impact on the environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                CO‚ÇÇ is a major greenhouse gas contributing to climate change. The more we understand our footprint, the more we can reduce it and make eco-friendly choices in our daily lives.
